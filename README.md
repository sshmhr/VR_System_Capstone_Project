## **Summary of the VR Game**

The project has a mystical theme and consists of a single room that changes according to the type of activity. 
The game starts with a welcome menu that has 2 options. 

The first option is to start the game while the other option ( settings ) is to be accessed by the clinicians to set up the various aspects ( like the number of reps and the stream ) of the game for the child. 

The child then selects start and is taken to the start room where he/she can select start to actually start the game. 
The game has 2 streams and 5 activities, the activities are sound agnostic and change slightly depending on the stream selected. For example, if the **Multisyllabic stream** is selected, the activity to push the book across the table just pushes the book slightly on every word uttered by the child, however, if the activity type is **LongStream** as soon as the child stops speaking, the book goes all the way through. 

If the number of words are more than the number of activities, the activities are rotated in a round-robin fashion, ie. The sixth word is practised in the first activity and so on. 
The game exits when either all the words are finished or the user chooses to exit. The theme is Harry Potter and the magic theme.
